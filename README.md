# Shadow Artifacts

Shadow Artifacts is a lore based mod for Minecraft. It's currently
in an EXTREMELY alpha stage of development, so don't expect too much.
In its alpha stages, the mod is currently impossible to play in survival
mode.

## Download

Downloads of "finished" versions can be found on curseforge and right here
in [the releases section][REL]. You can always clone the repository and build it
yourself though, if you want the bleeding edge build.

## Contributing

Found a bug, or want to add a feature? This section is for you! If you don't
know how to code in java (the programming language used) you can
[make an issue][ISU] with your bug or feature request. If it's an important
enough bug, or an  interesting enough feature it may get added to the mod
sometime!

If you do know how to code, you can fork the repository and make a pull
request. If it's good enough, it might get added into the main repository, and
the mod.
